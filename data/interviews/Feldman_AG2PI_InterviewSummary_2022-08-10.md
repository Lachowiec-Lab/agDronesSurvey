**What are the largest bottlenecks to adoption?**

1)  Multidisciplinary team is needed to run effective program. Lots of
    skills needed. Each person needs to get credit for the work they
    have performed. (AH, AB, SM, AT, JL/MB, PG)

    1.  Drone pilot (PG, AB, AH, JL/MB)

        1.  Pilot needs license

        2.  Knowledge of data collection best practices

    2.  Data analysis (AT, SM, AB, JL/MB, AH, LK)

        1.  R and/or Python skills

        2.  Statistics knowledge (spatial and temporal)

    3.  IT/Data storage/Metadata (SM, JL/MB, AH)

        1.  Huge amount of data is generated each flight, week, year,
            etc.

        2.  What metadata to include for multi-year, multi-site,
            multi-program studies

2)  Lack of affordable and easy to use equipment. Sensor integration
    challenges. (KS, LK, JL, PG, AT, RP)

    1.  Drone and sensor integration. Mission planning software, etc.
        (KS, LK, RP)

    2.  Cost of drone and sensor (AT, PG, AB)

    3.  Lack of standard protocols for diverse sensor and drone
        combinations (KS, LK, JL/MB, RP)

3)  Uncertainty about perceived value. (AT, PG)

**What are the most promising applications of drones in agriculture?**

1)  Precision agriculture applications. (LK, PG, AT, JL/MB, AB, RP, MB,
    IG)

    1.  Field scouting (PG, JL/MB, AT, RP, MB)

    2.  Decision support tools (AT, LK, JL/MB, AB, KS, RP, MB, IG)

        1.  Water, nutrient use/stress

        2.  Crop management (pest/pathogen control, growth regulator
            application)

        3.  Crop insurance estimates (hail damage, lodging, etc.)

    3.  Spot application of pesticides/small molecules (LK, JL/MB, MB)

2)  Crop phenotyping/Plant breeding (AB, LK, JL/MB, AH, KS, SM)

    1.  Measure plant traits: plant emergence, vigor, maturity, height,
        above ground biomass, growth curve data, senescence, light
        canopy interception (KS, AH, JL/MB, AB)

3)  Crop modeling/yield prediction (KS, SM, AH, JL/MB, LK, AT)

    1.  Yield prediction (AH, SM, KS, JL/MB)

    2.  Identify cause of plant stress (KS, AH)

    3.  Resource use efficiency (KS, JL/MB, AT)

**What are the least promising applications?**

1.  Complete automation of data collection we already perform well (AH,
    SM)

2.  Still a lot to be proven in regards to genetic gain in plant
    breeding for some crops and estimation of accurate physiological
    parameters (AT).

**What are some things you wish you would have known before you began
using a UAS?**

1.  Use of ground control points (GCP) to denote field boundaries (LK,
    AT, KS, JL/MB)

    1.  Best practices is generally 4 corners of the field with
        sometimes a 5<sup>th</sup> GCP in the middle. Folks who have RTK
        still use GCPs. (AT, KS, JL/MB)

2.  Calibration for multispectral/hyperspectral sensors (AT, LK, KS, PG,
    AB, JL/MB)

    1.  In some cases sensors are sold with calibration panels, in some
        cases they are not. In this cases calibration needs to be done
        in the lab (KS)

    2.  In some cases can use a downwelling light sensor (DLS) to adjust
        for sun irradiance (KS)

3.  Flight parameters for different sensor types (AB, LK)

    1.  Time of day is important. Does not need to be solar noon but
        needs to be consistent (KS, AB)

    2.  Flight speed, overlap, capture rate, altitude change by sensor
        type (AB)

    3.  Can reduce data capture rate for thermal images (LK)

4.  Learning to write computer scripts in a new language to communicate
    with colleagues (AH)

    1.  Needed to learn to script in R and Python to communicate with
        breeding colleagues (AH)

5.  Build a support team. Don’t try to do everything yourself (SM, AT,
    AH, JL/MB)

**What educational resources have you found most useful when developing
your own skillset with UAS-based imaging? **

1.  Hands on training with an experienced user. Find a collaborator with
    an incentive to work with you. Identify areas where unique skills
    apply to the same problem and apply knowledge (LK, SM, AH, AT, AB)

2.  Technical documents and text books (LK, PG, AT, KS)

    1.  Federal Aviation Administration resources, particularly Part 107
        chapters 11 and 14 for flight basics (LK)

    2.  Product manuals (LK, PG, AT)
